                <h4 class="pt-4 text-success ms-1">Career</h4>
            <p class="p-4">Pichai worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and in management consulting at 
            McKinsey & Company. Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product management and innovation 
            efforts for a suite of Google's client software products, including Google Chrome and ChromeOS, as well as 
            being largely responsible for Google Drive. He went on to oversee the development of other applications such

            released for trial and testing in 2011, and released to the public in 2012.[29] On May 20, 2010, he announced 
            the open-sourcing of the new video codec VP8 by Google and introduced the new video format, WebM.

            On March 13, 2013, Pichai added Android to the list of Google products that he oversaw. Android was formerly 
            managed by Andy Rubin. He was a director of Jive Software from April 2011 to July 30, 2013. Pichai was selected

            to become the next CEO of Google on August 10, 2015[35] after previously being appointed Product Chief by CEO,
            Larry Page. On October 24, 2015, he stepped into the new position at the completion of the formation of 
            Alphabet Inc., the new holding company for the Google company family.

            Pichai had been suggested as a contender for Microsoft's CEO in 2014, a position that was eventually given to 
            Satya Nadella.

            In August 2017, Pichai drew publicity for firing a Google employee who wrote a ten-page manifesto criticizing 
            the company's diversity policies.

            In December 2017, Pichai was a speaker at the World Internet Conference in China, where he stated that "a 
            lot of work Google does is to help Chinese companies. There are many small and medium-sized businesses in 
            China who take advantage of Google to get their products to many other countries outside of China."

            In December 2019, Pichai became the CEO of Alphabet Inc.


            Pichai delivers a speech virtually at the Singapore FinTech Festival 2020.
            In December 2020, Pichai delivered a speech virtually at the Singapore FinTech Festival emphasizing inclusive 
            digital economy.

            The coronavirus outbreak has sped up the adoption of digital tools and trends by years........Southeast 
            Asia's Internet economy is currently on the verge of a massive transformation......more than 40 million people
            in the region connected to the Internet for the first time in 2020 â€“ four times as many as the year before....
            ..while Covid has accelerated the use of digital tools, it's also exposed how many people are still left 
            behind......some 1.7 billion people around the world are still unbanked, a huge portion of African households
            do not have access to broadband and millions of women entrepreneurs lack the same access to opportunity as
            their male counterparts.
            Pichai said at the conclusion of his speech,

            Our goal for the post-Covid world is to ensure the benefits of technology can be shared, as widely and equitably as possible. If we can do that, 2020 will be remembered not as the end of the world, but the beginning of a world that works better for everyone
